This is a top-down dungeon crawler with real-time movement and turn-based combat.
With a space theme!


This is a collaborative thing we are doing for our course Object Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE).


A finished, compiled version of the game is in the zip in the "LootQuest" folder.

Older versions of the game can be seen in the wiki with the important milestones done, as well as in the github commits.
